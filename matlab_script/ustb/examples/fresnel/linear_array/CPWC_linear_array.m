%% Phantom
%
% The *fresnel* simulator takes a *phantom* structure as input. *phantom* is 
% an Ultrasound File Format (UFF) structure that contains the position of a 
% collection of point scatterers. USTB's implementation of phantom includes
% a *plot* method

pha=uff.phantom();
pha.sound_speed=1540;                 % speed of sound [m/s]
pha.points=[0,  0,  5e-3, 1;...
            0,  0, 10e-3, 1;...
            0,  0, 20e-3, 1;...
            0,  0, 30e-3, 1;...
            0,  0, 40e-3, 1;...
             10e-3,  0, 20e-3, 1;...
            -10e-3,  0, 20e-3, 1];    % point scatterer position [m]
fig_handle=pha.plot();           
             
%% Probe
%
% Another UFF structure is *probe*. You've guessed it, it contains
% information about the probe's geometry. USTB's implementation comes with
% a *plot* method. When combined with the previous Figure we can see the
% position of the probe respect to the phantom.

prb=uff.linear_array();
prb.N=128;                  % number of elements 
prb.pitch=300e-6;           % probe pitch in azimuth [m]
prb.element_width=270e-6;   % element width [m]
prb.element_height=5000e-6; % element height [m]
prb.plot(fig_handle);

%% Pulse
% 
% We need to define the pulse-echo signal which is a combination of the
% electrical pulse sent to each element and the element's electromechanical 
% transfer function. The model used in the built-in fresnel simulator is very 
% simple and it neglects the effect of the spatial impulse response. For a 
% more accurate model, use Field II (http://field-ii.dk/).
%
% In order to define the pulse-echo signal in the *fresnel* simulator the 
% structure *pulse* is used:
pul=uff.pulse();
pul.center_frequency=5.2e6;       % transducer frequency [MHz]
pul.fractional_bandwidth=0.6;     % fractional bandwidth [unitless]
pul.plot([],'2-way pulse');

%% Sequence generation
%
% Here comes something a bit more interesting. The *fresnel* simulator
% takes the same sequence definition as the USTB beamformer. In UFF and
% USTB a sequence is defined as a collection of *wave*. 
%
% The most important piece of information in a *wave* structure is the
% the location of the *source* that generated the wavefront. For the case
% of a plane-wave with inclination $\alpha$ the source is placed at the
% location $(r,\theta,\phi)=(\infty,\alpha,0)$.
%
% For flexibility reasons the *wave* structure holds all the information
% needed to beamform that specific transmitted wave, i.e. probe dimensions 
% and reference sound speed. That adds some data overhead, since the probe
% and sound speed are often the same for all transmit events in the sequence. But it 
% makes it possible to process each transmitting event independently. On the other
% hand it also simplifies the handling of probes with multiplexors and even
% allows for a more efficient use of the memory in those cases.
%
% We define a sequence of 31 plane-waves covering an angle span of $[-0.3,
% 0.3]$ radians. The *wave* structure has a *plot* method which plots the
% direction of the transmitted plane-wave.

F_number=1.7;
alpha_max=1/2/F_number;                
N=31;                                       % number of plane waves
angles=linspace(-alpha_max,alpha_max,N);    % angle vector [rad]
seq=uff.wave();
for n=1:N 
    seq(n)=uff.wave();
    seq(n).wavefront=uff.wavefront.plane;
    seq(n).source.azimuth=angles(n);
    
    seq(n).probe=prb;
    
    seq(n).sound_speed=pha.sound_speed;
    
    % show source
    fig_handle=seq(n).source.plot(fig_handle);
end

%% The Fresnel simulator
%
% We can finally launch the built-in simulator. This simulator uses
% fresnel approximation for a directive rectangular element. We need to
% assign the *phantom*, *pulse*, *probe*, sequence of *wave*, and the
% desired sampling frequency. The simulator returns a *channel_data* UFF
% structure.

sim=fresnel();

% setting input data 
sim.phantom=pha;                % phantom
sim.pulse=pul;                  % transmitted pulse
sim.probe=prb;                  % probe
sim.sequence=seq;               % beam sequence
sim.sampling_frequency=41.6e6;  % sampling frequency [Hz]

% we launch the simulation
channel_data=sim.go();
 
%% Scan
%
% The scan area is defined as a collection of pixels via another UFF structure.
% The *scan* is a general structure where the pixels have no spatial
% organization. That makes it very flexible, but a bit cumbersome to work
% with. But *scan* class has a number of children to help with that. In
% particular we here use the *linear_scan* structure, which is defined with
% just two axes. The *plot* method shows the position of the pixels in a 3D
% scenario.
scan=uff.linear_scan('x_axis', linspace(-19.2e-3,19.2e-3,200).', 'z_axis', linspace(0e-3,45e-3,100).');
scan.plot(fig_handle,'Scenario');    % show mesh
 
%% Pipeline
%
% With *channel_data* and a *scan* we have all we need to produce an
% ultrasound image. We now use a USTB structure *pipeline*, that takes an
% *apodization* structure in addition to the *channel_data* and *scan*.

pipe=pipeline();
pipe.channel_data=channel_data;
pipe.scan=scan;

pipe.receive_apodization.window=uff.window.hanning;
pipe.receive_apodization.f_number=F_number;
pipe.receive_apodization.minimum_aperture = [3e-3 3e-3];

pipe.transmit_apodization.window=uff.window.hanning;
pipe.transmit_apodization.f_number=F_number;
pipe.transmit_apodization.minimum_aperture = [3e-3 3e-3];

%% 
%
% The *pipeline* structure allows you to implement different beamformers 
% by combination of multiple built-in *processes*. The aim is to avoid code
% repetition and minimize implementation differences that could hinder
% inter-comparison. Here we combine two *processes* (*das_matlab* and 
% *coherent_compounding*) to produce coherently compounded images with 
% a MATLAB implementation of the DAS general beamformer. 
%
% By changing the *process* chain other beamforming sequences can be implemented. 
% For instance, in conventional focus imaging each transmit wave leads to a single scan
% line. In the end all the scanlines are stacked to produce a 2D image. In
% CPWC, however, a full image is produced for each transmit wave, the so
% called "low resolution image". Then all the images are coherently
% combined, i.e. added together, to produce a "high resolution image". 
% Notice that the exact same *process* is used in other sequences such as DWI or RTB.
%
% This division of the beamforming processing in *processes* is slower
% than combining the stages together in a single code, but it opens endless posibilities
% for implementing different techniques based on the same code blocks.
%
% The pipeline returns yet another *UFF* structure: *beamformed_data*
% which we can just display by using the method *plot*

% beamforming
b_data=pipe.go({midprocess.das() postprocess.coherent_compounding()});

% show
b_data.plot();
