# The effect of dynamic range alterations in the estimation of contrast #

This is the code used for the publication Rindal, O. M. H., Austeng, A., Fatemi, A., & Rodriguez-Molares, A.(2019). The effect of dynamic range alterations in the estimation of contrast. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control.

The main scripts are 

* create_figures_from_experimental.m
* create_figures_from_simulation.m

which creates most of the figures in the publication.

Secondly, the 

* dynamic_range_test.m

is a simpler example of how to run the dynamic range test.

The data is beamformed using 

* process_simulation.m 
* process_experimental.m

but these scripts can take some time to run...

In addition the other scripts in this folder creates some figures used for the discussion, mainly the images with only the axial gradient.
