<h2>Getting started with USTB</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

The UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) is a free, open source MATLAB toolbox for beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals. The aim of USTB is to facilitate the comparison between beamforming techniques and encourage the publication of datasets and algorithms. USTB is a joint effort of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the University of Oslo, the University of Lyon, and John Hopkins University.

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
USTB should be in MATLAB's path. Some examples require the use of third-party toolboxes such as Field II and k-Wave. More information is given in the corresponding examples.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>USTB includes the definition of an Ultrasound File Format (UFF) for channel and beamformed data.</li>
<li>USTB includes implementations for common beamforming sequences such as plane-wave compounding, diverging waves, retrospective beamforming.</li>
<li>USTB includes implementations of some adaptive beamforming algorithms such as coherence factor, phase coherence factor, generalised coherence factor.</li>
<li>USTB includes beamforming implementations for pararell multicore CPU in C, and GPU.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>
USTB includes a large collection of <a href="../demos.xml">examples</a> that can be found under examples in the toolbox folder.

<h3>Get help</h3>
The USTB has also a website <a href="http://www.ustb.no">www.ultrasoundtoolbox.com</a> with documentation and tutorials. The last version of USTB can be downloaded from USTB's repository in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/src/master/">bitbucket</a>. If you find any bug or issue with USTB you can open a ticket in our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/issues">issue tracker</a>.
